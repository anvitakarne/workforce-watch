## 🔗 **End-to-End Workflow: Connecting Google BigQuery, Colab & Looker Studio**
📡 **1️⃣ Google BigQuery → Google Colab**  
- The **raw employee dataset** is stored in **Google BigQuery**.
- Using **Python & SQL**, I extract relevant features and clean the data in **Google Colab**.

🤖 **2️⃣ Google Colab → Google BigQuery**  
- After feature engineering and training **Random Forest & XGBoost models**, predictions are **written back to BigQuery**.
- This makes it easier to integrate predictions with other company data.

📊 **3️⃣ Google BigQuery → Looker Studio**  
- The final predictions are pulled into **Looker Studio**, where HR teams can **visualize churn trends, identify high-risk employees, and make data-driven retention decisions**.
